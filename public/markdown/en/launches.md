#### TokenOro is Live on Worbli

The Gold Storage and Gold Streaming Token is Now Available to Accredited Investors.

TokenOro was created to **solve the challenge** of raising capital which small miners struggle with on a regular basis. With the cost of geological testing and the expense of full-blown gold production, artisanal mining outfits fight to survive. Usually, survival can only happen if they sell 80-90% ownership of their mine (at a low valuation) to a large mining consortium -—- **even when they have gold in the ground.**

The management team of TokenOro spent years raising capital for mining projects the old fashioned way but they decided to find an alternative solution. They **partnered** with **WORBLI** to create a token and a funding model that had **never been done before**.
