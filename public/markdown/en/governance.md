### The WORBLI governance model has been designed with enterprise needs and regulators in mind

A critical trait is a built-in governance layer. For WORBLI, That means we can set the rules of the blockchain in the foundation. 

- Our user accounts have a one-time AML/KYC process built right in at the point of creation. 
- All user accounts, transactions, and nodes will follow the rules of the governance layer that we implement. 
- Block producing nodes come under our secure compliance guidelines and submit to regular auditing of ownership stakes. 
- This makes WORBLI perfect for any developer that wants to create an application where financial security and scalability are paramount.
- All this with zero cost to applications

WORBLIâ€™s network governance is designed to meet the regulatory needs of global financial services and financial technology businesses. \n

- Free Verified Accounts for individual users.\n
- WORBLI will provide account recovery for all users; therefore if private keys are lost - there is a process for the user to recover their account.\n
- Dispute resolution that is based on law and provides the same security as users would expect in the real world.

#### Decentralization.

WORBLI is the first compliant public blockchain infrastructure. In order to ensure the most efficient system, we will be decentralizing the network to ensure distributed decision making. The first of its kind in a public compliant blockchain.

#### Requirements of Applications.

The WORBLI network is a compliance-focused blockchain. This being said all of our applications must undergo compliance checks to ensure they are safe, legal, and licensed for their perspective use cases by the WORBLI Foundation. This means vetting the team through KYB (know your business) and ensuring adequate security and penetration testing. The network must be safe. It must be compliant. The decentralized WORBLI foundation will be tasked with the effort of ensuring that applications who launch on WORBLI consider the security of the user base.

#### Applications that may not qualify to be on WORBLI could potentially include:
- Unlicensed gambling
- Applications based in jurisdictions that may have sanctions
- Applications who have directors that may be involved in financial crime or money laundering

The decentralized WORBLI Foundation will undertake due diligence efforts to the best of their ability to ensure that launching on WORBLI is accessible, but also that the people who are operating on the network have a level of protection that allows them to feel safe.
