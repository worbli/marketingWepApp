**EOSIO 1.8.1 Being Deployed on WORBLI**

At **WORBLI**, we are working hard to provide the **best possible platform** for enterprise-grade applications using compliant, easy, and accessible blockchain network architecture. A significant amount of **strategic energy** is directed to ensuring **developers** have access to the **latest innovations** in the EOSIO space.

Block.One is constantly working on **pushing EOSIO** architecture **forward** which was largely our reason for keeping the base code of WORBLI unaltered. WORBLI also benefits from having a steady group of Block Producers to work with who can easily collaborate and coordinate their efforts to make updates like this quick and seamlessly.

The release of **EOSIO 1.8 was historic**, as it is the first consensus protocol update since 1.0. This means that all of the Block Producers were required to replay **the whole blockchain** in order to upgrade and **stay** in **sync** with the rest of the nodes. EOSIO 1.8 also emphasizes protocol features, which are enabled through block header extensions.
