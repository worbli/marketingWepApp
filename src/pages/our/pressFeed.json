The value proposition of DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is a system that will enable efficient, transparent and fair financial services for the world. This can only be achieved with cutting-edge technology and features such as the recently developed WORBLI Token Protocol (WTP), available to all developers building applications on the WORBLI\u00a0network.</p>\n<p>The WTP will allow developers using the WORBLI Network to create certain parameters and rulesets within on-chain token contracts, opening up a plethora of opportunities around functionality and compliance. In conventional application development, these parameters and rulesets would need to be built into the application or chain layer, creating friction and bottlenecks for users and developers alike.</p>\n<p>The WORBLI Token Protocol is made possible through the use of on-chain registries that provide data associated with our network chain accounts. Smart contracts are able to obtain this data, allowing for specific parameters to be added for users. While the registries provide account level control of on-chain activities, we also provide a set of token contract enhancements to apply controls against properties of the token such as token supply, number of unique holders, and number of transfers; granting token issuers and developers increased flexibility.</p>\n<p>With the WORBLI Token Protocol, development and compliance structuring times are significantly reduced. Some of the features that can be easily implemented at the token level are listed\u00a0below.</p>\n<p><strong>Geolocated Tokens</strong></p>\n<p>This feature will allow developers to track and monitor their user\u2019s tokens and gain location statistics, allowing for enhanced geolocated human aid and charities with cryptocurrencies, community/country-based currencies, voting tokens within a specific area, and augmented reality capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Accredited Investor\u00a0Tokens</strong></p>\n<p>Friction around onboarding accredited investors for applications and fundraising will be significantly reduced with the WTP. The protocol will enable developers to set certain rules around accredited investors and provide a single check for accredited investors for multiple investment opportunities. This will be particularly valuable to companies looking to implement a Security Token Offering (STO), with the ability to track and monitor tokens belonging to accredited investors.</p>\n<p><strong>Transfer Limits</strong></p>\n<p>The WTP allows developers to set certain transfer limits when dealing with the exchange of tokens, along with various other token\u00a0metrics.</p>\n<p><strong>Compliance</strong></p>\n<p>Compliance is made even easier on the WORBLI Network, with the reduction in the amount of transactional monitoring a compliant business has to perform and the ability to Assign permissions to tokens to simplify compliance requirements.</p>\n<p>Everything that we do at WORBLI is focused on reducing friction; whether that be from a developer\u2019s standpoint, compliance for a startup, or for users of our network and applications. The WORBLI Token Protocol is yet another tool for the belt of our developers who are working on building the next generation of financial services, capable of bringing fairness and inclusion to the\u00a0world.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RyFyDFNPp-c8j0A_1sHrtQ.png\"></figure><p>The <strong>WORBLI</strong> business development team loves working with great projects.

This will be particularly valuable to companies looking to implement a Security Token Offering (STO), with the ability to track and monitor tokens belonging to accredited investors.</p>\n<p><strong>Transfer Limits</strong></p>\n<p>The WTP allows developers to set certain transfer limits when dealing with the exchange of tokens, along with various other token\u00a0metrics.</p>\n<p><strong>Compliance</strong></p>\n<p>Compliance is made even easier on the WORBLI Network, with the reduction in the amount of transactional monitoring a compliant business has to perform and the ability to Assign permissions to tokens to simplify compliance requirements.</p>\n<p>Everything that we do at WORBLI is focused on reducing friction; whether that be from a developer\u2019s standpoint, compliance for a startup, or for users of our network and applications. The WORBLI Token Protocol is yet another tool for the belt of our developers who are working on building the next generation of financial services, capable of bringing fairness and inclusion to the\u00a0world.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RyFyDFNPp-c8j0A_1sHrtQ.png\"></figure><p>The <strong>WORBLI</strong> business development team loves working with great projects.

Our vision has always been that initially, we will have tight centralized control as we evolve and refine our processes, with the end goal being stability and predictability. Having good checks and balances against abuse or misuse of power requires a certain degree of decentralization, and we are making progress toward that\u00a0goal.</p>\n<p>During the month of December, we are updating our Platform and Network Terms to note that disputes will now be subject to arbitration rather than going straight to the Courts of Singapore.</p>\n<h3>Meet Ben\u00a0Gates</h3>\n<p>The Foundation has appointed the first independent arbitrator to handle any disputes that may arise in connection with using the WORBLI network or the WORBLI Foundation operations. Ben\u2019s education in law was an important factor in our decision to appoint him, but the recommendations we received from his work with ECAF as an interim arbitrator and administrator of the EOS arbitration forum was the deciding factor. Ben has been involved in EOS governance discussions from a very early stage and is excited to help the WORBLI network take the next step towards decentralization. We feel this puts him in a great position to act as an expert well versed in the nuances of blockchain and therefore we hope he will be able to resolve disputes between parties in a fair, balanced and well-reasoned manner.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Ben\u2019s entrepreneurial background will be important as the WORBLI network scales and the need arises for an independent arbitration association to be\u00a0formed.</p>\n<p>Ben has been appointed to act independently and will deal with disputes in accordance with the WORBLI Arbitration Process Rules. To avoid any conflict of interest, the arbitrator receives a yearly fee in advance from the Foundation that cannot be taken back and the annual term cannot be suspended or terminated earlier by the Foundation. We believe that this approach ensures that the independence of the arbitrator will not be compromised.</p>\n<h3>Checks and\u00a0Balances</h3>\n<p>We firmly believe that arbitrators that will deal with disputes on the WORBLI network need to possess certain qualities to be qualified for the job: strong moral compass, good education, independence, unquestionable honesty, experience with the law, and emotional stability. We thoroughly vetted Ben before deciding to appoint him, including rigorous background checks and references from people he has worked with. We are confident that Ben is well-suited for the job and will contribute to the further development of WORBLI\u2019s arbitration rules and processes.</p>\n<p>Of course, just appointing someone that we believe will do a good job is not enough. We have devised a process where we believe it will be nearly impossible for an arbitrator to harm a network participant, whether it is intentional or\u00a0not.</p>\n<p>Arbitrators in the WORBLI network only have the power to decide on disputes. Once an award is given, a request is sent to the WORBLI Foundation executive body, which is responsible for executing it. Our goal is to achieve the division of powers that is paramount in modern governance theory. The executive body has the power to execute decisions, but it cannot do that unless a decision has been made in the first place. The arbitrators (and other decision-making bodies such as the Foundation internal regulatory body) have the power to make decisions but not to execute them. This makes it impossible for a single actor to do harm. Further, each privileged action that is performed on the network as a result of a decision is put on-chain to be fully auditable and accessible by anyone. This kind of transparency is unprecedented outside of the blockchain world, and we are hopeful it will lead to a better and more transparent future.</p>\n<p>Parties to a dispute have the right to appeal if they feel the decision was unfair. Ultimately, any arbitrator decision can be challenged in court, so we can always fall back to the established legal\u00a0system.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we will be implementing more checks on the arbitrator decisions, such as peer review of cases and a new role that we call \u201cthe ombudsman\u201d. The ombudsman will have the power to inquire into any case and investigate it for abuse of power or audit the reasoning behind the decision.

      "content": "\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*kufAX1R95GwFkFD4zeJ1Pw.jpeg\"></figure><p>The WORBLI project was conceived from the start to transition into a decentralized network as it matures. Our vision has always been that initially, we will have tight centralized control as we evolve and refine our processes, with the end goal being stability and predictability. Having good checks and balances against abuse or misuse of power requires a certain degree of decentralization, and we are making progress toward that\u00a0goal.</p>\n<p>During the month of December, we are updating our Platform and Network Terms to note that disputes will now be subject to arbitration rather than going straight to the Courts of Singapore.</p>\n<h3>Meet Ben\u00a0Gates</h3>\n<p>The Foundation has appointed the first independent arbitrator to handle any disputes that may arise in connection with using the WORBLI network or the WORBLI Foundation operations. Ben\u2019s education in law was an important factor in our decision to appoint him, but the recommendations we received from his work with ECAF as an interim arbitrator and administrator of the EOS arbitration forum was the deciding factor. Ben has been involved in EOS governance discussions from a very early stage and is excited to help the WORBLI network take the next step towards decentralization. We feel this puts him in a great position to act as an expert well versed in the nuances of blockchain and therefore we hope he will be able to resolve disputes between parties in a fair, balanced and well-reasoned manner.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Ben\u2019s entrepreneurial background will be important as the WORBLI network scales and the need arises for an independent arbitration association to be\u00a0formed.</p>\n<p>Ben has been appointed to act independently and will deal with disputes in accordance with the WORBLI Arbitration Process Rules. To avoid any conflict of interest, the arbitrator receives a yearly fee in advance from the Foundation that cannot be taken back and the annual term cannot be suspended or terminated earlier by the Foundation. We believe that this approach ensures that the independence of the arbitrator will not be compromised.</p>\n<h3>Checks and\u00a0Balances</h3>\n<p>We firmly believe that arbitrators that will deal with disputes on the WORBLI network need to possess certain qualities to be qualified for the job: strong moral compass, good education, independence, unquestionable honesty, experience with the law, and emotional stability. We thoroughly vetted Ben before deciding to appoint him, including rigorous background checks and references from people he has worked with. We are confident that Ben is well-suited for the job and will contribute to the further development of WORBLI\u2019s arbitration rules and processes.</p>\n<p>Of course, just appointing someone that we believe will do a good job is not enough. We have devised a process where we believe it will be nearly impossible for an arbitrator to harm a network participant, whether it is intentional or\u00a0not.</p>\n<p>Arbitrators in the WORBLI network only have the power to decide on disputes. Once an award is given, a request is sent to the WORBLI Foundation executive body, which is responsible for executing it. Our goal is to achieve the division of powers that is paramount in modern governance theory. The executive body has the power to execute decisions, but it cannot do that unless a decision has been made in the first place. The arbitrators (and other decision-making bodies such as the Foundation internal regulatory body) have the power to make decisions but not to execute them. This makes it impossible for a single actor to do harm. Further, each privileged action that is performed on the network as a result of a decision is put on-chain to be fully auditable and accessible by anyone. This kind of transparency is unprecedented outside of the blockchain world, and we are hopeful it will lead to a better and more transparent future.</p>\n<p>Parties to a dispute have the right to appeal if they feel the decision was unfair. Ultimately, any arbitrator decision can be challenged in court, so we can always fall back to the established legal\u00a0system.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we will be implementing more checks on the arbitrator decisions, such as peer review of cases and a new role that we call \u201cthe ombudsman\u201d. The ombudsman will have the power to inquire into any case and investigate it for abuse of power or audit the reasoning behind the decision. The ombudsman will not have the power to decide on a case but will be able to initiate claims on behalf of everyone or reopen old cases if they are deemed to be processed incorrectly.</p>\n<p>We believe that this is an important step in the development and decentralization of the WORBLI network and we are looking forward to seeing how it will be utilized in the future. The ability to fairly resolve disputes between network users sets the foundation for a global financial ecosystem.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RyFyDFNPp-c8j0A_1sHrtQ.png\"></figure><p>The <strong>WORBLI</strong> business development team loves working with great projects.

Our \u201cUtility\u201d driven economic model provides a stable and rational base protocol to power decentralized applications on a commercially viable basis. The ownership of WBI is not limited to those developing applications who directly require resources. In fact, our belief is that most applications will not own WBI but access the resource through our \u201cMiddleware\u201d tools that optimize resource allocation. This optimization lowers resource costs for business and consumers whilst minimizing latent resources on the network. It is this rationality and price discovery, combined with our ever-evolving compliance framework, that will drive the growth and scale of our network as the base protocol of choice for DeFi applications.</p>\n<p>Our economic model re-allocates resources to those contributing to Utility. That is not just direct usage but allowing others to use your resources. The delegation of resources back to the chain, whilst maintaining ownership of WBI, is critical to the optimization process and is self-serving to a WBI owner. Since most applications will not own WBI directly, a \u201cLandlord\u201d and \u201cTenant\u201d relationship will evolve within our ecosystem analogous to digital real\u00a0estate.</p>\n<p>Within our resource model is a rolling 28-day lending facility available to WBI holders. This provides a \u201cStandby\u201d resource for applications that can borrow on a daily basis from this facility. WBI placed in the facility receives a proportion of inflation irrespective of any lending activity and an inflation-linked lending fee from borrowers in the event that demand is present. The pricing for both are algorithmically based on the Utility of the network which completes the economic loop for our stakeholders in a truly aligned structure.</p>\n<p>In addition, our Middleware tools, enable further options for WBI holders to provide their resources back to the network in different ways. In particular, Chintai and UtilityX provide different strategies for applications and users to exchange resources. Chintai offers a lending and borrowing model whereas UtilityX offers liquidity in Utility derivatives- the digital resource equivalents of a commercial bank and a commodities exchange. Both models, individually and combined, provide price discovery, drive efficiency and lower implicit and explicit costs for running a business on\u00a0WORBLI.</p>\n<p>Our current plans for 2020 involve establishing a facility via UtilityX whereby WBI holders can contribute their resources to an externally managed pool that supports and invests in a variety of DeFi and fintech focused applications. This pool of resources is used to support and invest in WORBLI applications exclusively on commercial terms. Several applications have already signed deals on this basis and more are under\u00a0review.</p>\n<p>WBI holders benefit directly from contributing to the network and enjoy the catalytic stimulus on the network. These actions increase the potential value of the very resources they own. Furthermore, our model allows them to benefit not just from the network itself, but from the Utility that sits above it. As enterprise adoption commences, reliance on the value in a horizontal base protocol will be\u00a0reduced.</p>\n<p>As we grow and our user base evolves, the network emphasis will shift to resource liquidity, pricing and efficiency.

Our \u201cUtility\u201d driven economic model provides a stable and rational base protocol to power decentralized applications on a commercially viable basis. The ownership of WBI is not limited to those developing applications who directly require resources. In fact, our belief is that most applications will not own WBI but access the resource through our \u201cMiddleware\u201d tools that optimize resource allocation. This optimization lowers resource costs for business and consumers whilst minimizing latent resources on the network. It is this rationality and price discovery, combined with our ever-evolving compliance framework, that will drive the growth and scale of our network as the base protocol of choice for DeFi applications.</p>\n<p>Our economic model re-allocates resources to those contributing to Utility. That is not just direct usage but allowing others to use your resources. The delegation of resources back to the chain, whilst maintaining ownership of WBI, is critical to the optimization process and is self-serving to a WBI owner. Since most applications will not own WBI directly, a \u201cLandlord\u201d and \u201cTenant\u201d relationship will evolve within our ecosystem analogous to digital real\u00a0estate.</p>\n<p>Within our resource model is a rolling 28-day lending facility available to WBI holders. This provides a \u201cStandby\u201d resource for applications that can borrow on a daily basis from this facility. WBI placed in the facility receives a proportion of inflation irrespective of any lending activity and an inflation-linked lending fee from borrowers in the event that demand is present. The pricing for both are algorithmically based on the Utility of the network which completes the economic loop for our stakeholders in a truly aligned structure.</p>\n<p>In addition, our Middleware tools, enable further options for WBI holders to provide their resources back to the network in different ways. In particular, Chintai and UtilityX provide different strategies for applications and users to exchange resources. Chintai offers a lending and borrowing model whereas UtilityX offers liquidity in Utility derivatives- the digital resource equivalents of a commercial bank and a commodities exchange. Both models, individually and combined, provide price discovery, drive efficiency and lower implicit and explicit costs for running a business on\u00a0WORBLI.</p>\n<p>Our current plans for 2020 involve establishing a facility via UtilityX whereby WBI holders can contribute their resources to an externally managed pool that supports and invests in a variety of DeFi and fintech focused applications. This pool of resources is used to support and invest in WORBLI applications exclusively on commercial terms. Several applications have already signed deals on this basis and more are under\u00a0review.</p>\n<p>WBI holders benefit directly from contributing to the network and enjoy the catalytic stimulus on the network. These actions increase the potential value of the very resources they own. Furthermore, our model allows them to benefit not just from the network itself, but from the Utility that sits above it. As enterprise adoption commences, reliance on the value in a horizontal base protocol will be\u00a0reduced.</p>\n<p>As we grow and our user base evolves, the network emphasis will shift to resource liquidity, pricing and efficiency. The underlying WBI tokens will represent the \u201cFreeholder\u201d interests of the network. In our genesis stage, current owners are in a unique position to stake their claim as pioneers and stewards of the future of Decentralised Financial Markets.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*myfkQK7eC8xJSZhjq4Qp3w.jpeg\"></figure><p>The <strong>WORBLI</strong> business development team loves working with great projects.
