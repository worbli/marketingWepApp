          The not for profit organization maintained by our community, block
          producers and board members is committed to fulfilling our vision
          through the creation of a vibrant WORBLI community, with the following
          protocols:
        </p>

        <p>
          Project Software will be open-sourced, with some potential patent
          applications for proprietary technology - all community-owned
        </p>

        <p>
          Decentralized decision-making by the community for all macroeconomic
          decisions
        </p>

        <p>
          Day-to-day operations, marketing, and general project management
          executed by the WORBLI Foundation team
        </p>

        <p>Total financial transparency</p>

        <p>
          Board of directors made up of representatives from our Block Producers
          to start and evolving into a representation of the whole of WORBLIâ€™s
          stakeholders.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Board members will be elected annually to continue their service
          or be replaced by newly elected members through processes in our
          governance model.
        </p>

        <p>The Board will provide guidance and approval for:</p>

        <p>Contracts and compensation</p>

        <p>Budgets</p>

        <p>Strategic planning</p>
