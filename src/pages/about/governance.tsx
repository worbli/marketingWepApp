        <p>
          A critical trait is a built-in governance layer. For WORBLI, That
          means we can set the rules of the blockchain in the foundation
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Our user accounts have a one-time AML/KYC process built right in at
            the point of creation
          </li>

          <li>
            All user accounts, transactions, and nodes will follow the rules of
            the governance layer that we implement
          </li>

          <li>
            Block producing nodes come under our secure compliance guidelines
            and submit to regular auditing of ownership stakes
          </li>

          <li>
            This makes WORBLI perfect for any developer that wants to create an
            application where financial security and scalability are paramount.
          </li>

          <li>All this with zero cost to applications</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          WORBLIâ€™s network governance is designed to meet the regulatory needs
          of global financial services and financial technology businesses.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Free Verified Accounts for individual users</li>

          <li>
            WORBLI will provide account recovery for all users; therefore if
            private keys are lost - there is a process for the user to recover
            their account
          </li>

          <li>
            Dispute resolution that is based on law and provides the same
            security as users would expect in the real world
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Decentralization</h4>

        <p>
          WORBLI is the first compliant public blockchain infrastructure. In
          order to ensure the most efficient system, we will be decentralizing
          the network to ensure distributed decision making. The first of its
          kind in a public compliant blockchain.
        </p>

        <h4>Application Requirements</h4>

        <p>
          The WORBLI network is a compliance-focused blockchain. This being said
          all of our applications must undergo compliance checks to ensure they
          are safe, legal, and licensed for their perspective use cases by the
          WORBLI Foundation. This means vetting the team through know your
          business (KYB) and ensuring adequate security and penetration testing.
          The network must be safe. It must be compliant. The decentralized
          WORBLI foundation will be tasked with the effort of ensuring that
          applications who launch on WORBLI consider the security of the user
          base.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Applications that may not qualify to be on WORBLI could potentially
          include:
        </h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Unlicensed gambling</li>

          <li>Applications based in jurisdictions that may have sanctions</li>

          <li>
            Applications who have directors that may be involved in financial
            crime or money laundering
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The decentralized WORBLI Foundation will undertake due diligence
          efforts to the best of its ability to ensure that launching on
          WORBLI is accessible, but also that the people who are operating on
          the network have a level of protection that allows them to feel safe.
