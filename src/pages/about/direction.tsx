            WORBLI was created with the intention of supplying a safe platform
            for users and developers to experience the benefits of distributed
            ledger technology (DLT) without the risks. It is a platform that is
            robust enough to scale to the speed and accessibility of modern
            centralized platforms while reducing user friction and costs to
            applications. Worbli is where the most innovative of applications
            can exist within the confines of the latest regulatory restrictions;
            where compliance and innovation are at the forefront of the mission.
          </p>

          <p>
            DLT has typically been out of reach for the average person. The need
            for high technical knowledge combined with its complex process and
            unsecured accounts have kept DLT solutions from being adopted by the
            masses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Simple user accounts, user supplied resources, recoverable account
            access, and easy integrations with existing technology are necessary
            to ensure the growth and development of this incredible technology.
            If it's not better than existing systems, it won't last the test of
            time. WORBLI has the infrastructure required to bridge the gap from
            digital assets to existing financial systems whilst enabling
            Decentralized Finance (DeFi).
          </p>

          <p>
            Government regulation is not going away. At the same time, as new
            rules pop up, we can learn to adapt and pivot. WORBLI makes that
            pivot easy. WORBLI is creating an accessible and fair DeFi
            infrastructure for innovators, the unbanked, and dreamers.
